            Looking for another way to use up the sourdough starter that's
            floating around your fridge? These bagels are a flavourful option,
            that can easily be frozen for a quick meal on the go.
          </p>
          <h2>Here's what you need:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>6 grams dry yeast</li>
            <li>10 grams sugar</li>
            <li>15 grams malt powder</li>
            <li>185 grams sourdough starter</li>
            <li>350 grams sifted wheat flour</li>
            <li>90 grams sifted rye flour</li>
            <li>6 grams salt</li>
            <li>
              20 grams of either honey, dark brown sugar, molasses, or malt
              extract
            </li>
            <li>Flake salt or toppings of your choice</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Directions:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a large mixing bowl, stir together yeast, sugar and malt powder
              with 120 grams of body temperature water. Allow to rest for 10
              minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the sourdough starter and 150 grams of water, mixing
              thoroughly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Last, add the wheat flour, rye flour, and salt to the bowl with
              the starter. Combine until a shaggy dough forms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn the dough onto a well floured work surface and hand knead for
              5-8 minutes, or until a smooth dough forms. Do NOT use a machine
              to knead the dough. Home use machines are generally not strong
              enough to mix bagel dough, and doing so could break the motor.
            </li>

              alt="hands kneading bagel dough."
            />
            <li>
              Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and allow to rise
              until almost doubled in size.
            </li>
            <li>
              Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces (approximately 80 grams
              each). Roll each piece into a tight ball and allow to rest for
              another 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bring 1.5 litres of water to simmer in a wide pot, and stir in the
              20 grams of sweetener of your choice.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 210 degrees Celsius.</li>
            <li>
              Form dough balls into bagels, and rest another five minutes.
            </li>

            />
            <li>
              Prepare any toppings or salt that you would like to flavour your
              bagels, and a baking sheet with parchment paper to bake your
              bagels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Working with 2-4 bagels at a time, gently place bagels in the pot
              and simmer for 2 minutes on each side. Be careful not to overcrowd
              the pot, so that they do not stick together. Remove with a slotted
              spoon and place on the baking sheet.
            </li>

              alt="Simmering bagels in a pot."
            />
            <li>
              While bagels are still sticky, sprinkle any salt or toppings you
              have chosen.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once all of your bagels are prepared, bake for 20 minutes or until
              very golden brown. Depending on how evenly your oven cooks, you
              may need to rotate the pan half way through cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bagels are best enjoyed while freshly baked. If you do not plan to
              eat them within 24 hours, it's better to pre-slice and then freeze
              them. Frozen bagels can be reheated in the toaster, ready for easy
              breakfasts.
