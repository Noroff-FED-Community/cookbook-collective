# cookbook-collective

A website where users can collaborate and share their favorite recipes, tips, and tricks with others. It's a community-driven platform where foodies can come together to learn, grow, and experiment in the kitchen.

## Online

The site is deployed at this link: [https://cookbook-collective.netlify.app/](https://cookbook-collective.netlify.app/)

## Template

A template for the recipe pages can be found in the repo, it's file name is (drum roll) "template.html"
Please add your HTML in the div with the class "recipe-main" (the one with the comment saying: "Your recipe here")

### "This site need changes!"

Let the scrum master know if you would like to make changes to the site/template. For instance adding new categories.

## Keen on adding CSS?

Let the scrum master know! styles.css could potensially be a very sought after file for making changes, so we should communicate well in order not to get merge conflicts.

## Questions?

Let's hop on the Teams channel to sort things out if there are questions. Or really, just whenever :D
